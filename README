Lets see if we can play around with HTML 5.0 sound and create a clojure/lisp that runs on browser,
so we can have fun with music-as-data (mad.emotionull.com).

Steps:
* DONE HTML 5.0 sound demo
* DONE REPL on browser 
* TODO Create timings
* TODO Lisp On browser (search for similar projects)
* TODO Gist on browser
